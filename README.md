# Computer Vision Project - Lyft Udacity Semantic Segmentation for Self-driving Cars

This project is part of the assessment for the Deep Learning specialization's Computer Vision with Deep Learning course at CIn-UFPE. It aims to employ Semantic Segmentation techniques to perform multi-class classification on a self-driving car dataframe available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumaresanmanickavelu/lyft-udacity-challenge).
